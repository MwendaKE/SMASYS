# SMASYS

School Management System Software in Python and Kivy.

It uses a NoSQL database (mongodb) that is supported by a local mongoDB server (mongod) to store and manage all the data fed into the app.

Open the 'demo' folder above to see the file outputs of the app. You can also play the demo-video.mp4 file to see the app working live.

You can contribute or raise any issues in the app through this platform or directory to my email: erickmwenda256@gmail.com.
