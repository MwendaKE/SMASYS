# SMASYS

School Management System Software Project written in Python and Kivy.

It uses a NoSQL database (mongodb) that is supported by a local mongoDB server (mongod) to store and manage all the data fed into the app.

Open the 'demo' folder to see the file outputs of the app. You can also play the demo-video.mp4 files to see the app working live.

You can contribute or raise any issues within the app through this platform or directory to my email: erickmwenda256@gmail.com.

The project can be compiled to a standalone android app (.apk) using buildozer.
